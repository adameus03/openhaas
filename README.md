# openhaas

### Overview
OpenHaaS is an open initiative to create a global platform where the user selects a desired hardware device that they would like to reserve for use in a specified time window, from a worldwide list of available hardware and users "hosting" the hardware. 
Anyone shall be able to create an account and add their own HaaS unit with its own reservation calendar or reserve hours for any desired hardware. The types of hardware shall include the full range of available technologies: radio modules, but also GPU's, network adapters, FPGAs, MCUs, etc.. Anyone shall be able to add and/or use what they like to use.

### Basic CLI usage - for users providing hardware to the world
Run `$ openhaas instance create` on the device you want to expose

### Basic CLI usage - for users willing to connect to reserved hardware
Run `$ openhaas instance connect <KEY>` to connect to a pending reservation using a reservation access key.

### Installation
